Note
Generally, you should try to avoid using column or table names containing spaces or using reserved words(Key Word) in SQL. For example, it's best to avoid names like table or first name.
If you must use such names, put them between back-tick `` delimiters. For example:
CREATE TABLE `table` ( `first name` VARCHAR(30) );
A query containing the back-tick delimiters on this table might be:
 SELECT `first name` FROM `table` WHERE `first name` LIKE 'a%';
