This is the basic way to insert data from another table with the SELECT statement.
INSERT INTO `tableA` (`field_one`, `field_two`)
SELECT `tableB`.`field_one`, `tableB`.`field_two`   FROM `tableB`   WHERE `tableB`.clmn <> 'someValue'   ORDER BY `tableB`.`sorting_clmn`;

You can SELECT * FROM, but then tableA and tableB must have matching column count and corresponding datatypes.
Columns with AUTO_INCREMENT are treated as in the INSERT with VALUES clause.
This syntax makes it easy to ﬁll (temporary) tables with data from other tables, even more so when the data is to be ﬁltered on the insert.
