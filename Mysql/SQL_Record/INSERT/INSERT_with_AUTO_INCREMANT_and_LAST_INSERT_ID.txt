When a table has an AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, normally one does not insert into that column. Instead, specify all the other columns, then ask what the new id was.
CREATE TABLE t (    id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,    this ...,    that ...,    PRIMARY KEY(id) );
INSERT INTO t (this, that) VALUES (..., ...);
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() INTO @id;
INSERT INTO another_table (..., t_id, ...) VALUES (..., @id, ...);

Note that LAST_INSERT_ID() is tied to the session, so even if multiple connections are inserting into the same table, each with get its own id.
Your client API probably has an alternative way of getting the LAST_INSERT_ID() without actually performing a SELECT
and handing the value back to the client instead of leaving it in an @variable inside MySQL. Such is usually preferable.
