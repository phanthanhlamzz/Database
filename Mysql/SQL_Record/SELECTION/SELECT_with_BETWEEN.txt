Query with operators
SELECT * FROM stack WHERE id >= 2 and id <= 5;
Similar query with BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM stack WHERE id BETWEEN 2 and 5;


Using NOT BETWEEN
If you want to use the negative you can use NOT. For example :
SELECT * FROM stack WHERE id NOT BETWEEN 2 and 5;

NOTE:
If you have an index on a column you use in a BETWEEN search, MySQL can use that index for a range scan.
