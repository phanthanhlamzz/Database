Adding privileges

Grant common, basic privileges to the user for all tables of the speciﬁed database:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database-Name.* TO 'userName'@'localhost';

Grant all privileges to the user for all tables on all databases (attention with this):
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'userName'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

As demonstrated above, *.* targets all databases and tables, databaseName.* targets all tables of the speciﬁc database. It is also possible to specify database and table like so databaseName.tableName.
WITH GRANT OPTION should be left out if the user need not be able to grant other users privileges.

Privileges can be either
ALL

or a combination of the following, each separated by a comma (non-exhaustive list).
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
CREATE
DROP


NOTE:
Saving Your Changes
As a final step following any updates to the user privileges, be sure to save the changes by issuing the FLUSH PRIVILEGES command from the mysql prompt:
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
