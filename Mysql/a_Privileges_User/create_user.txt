Creating user
First, you need to create a user and then give the user permissions on certain databases/tables. While creating the user, you also need to specify where this user can connect from.

+CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password';
 Will create a user that can only connect on the local machine where the database is hosted.

+CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password';
 Will create a user that can connect from anywhere (except the local machine).
